##Whodunit 

- BMPs are 24 bits
- 1 byte is 8 bits
- 8 bits each are used to signify each color (red, blue, and green) (8*3 = 24)
- BMPS store color information backwards, as BGR.
- 0xff means 100% of this color (0xff = 255 in decimal)
- 0x00 means 0% of this color
- metadata of the BMP is stored in the header of the file
- the header is comprised of the following:
    -bitmapfileheader (14 bytes)
    -bitmapinofheader (40 bytes
    
- 'To be clear, recall that a hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. Accordingly, ffffff in hexadecimal actually signifies 111111111111111111111111 in binary.'
