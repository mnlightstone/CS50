/*Lecture Week 1*/

when naming files, always use lowercase - no spaces

IDE - integrated devloper environment 

compiling means converting code into machine code
source code -> compiler -> machine code

	$clang FILE-NAME
	clang <- clanguage

when we run a compiler is output in an 'a.out' file

to run code in cs50's IDE:
	./a.out

	. 		<- look in my current directory
	/ 		<- separator 
	a.out   <- compiled file name
	
to name a file in cs50's IDE:
	clang -o hello hello.c
	
	clang   <- compile (clanguage)
	-o 	  	<- stands to output
	hello	<- file name we want
	hello.c <- file we want to compile
	
	
	
command line commands:
	**ls** - list all the files in this directory. 
			/* programs are green with starts (executable)
				text files are white 
				folders are blue with a trailing slash */
				
	**mkdir** - make directory
	**rmdir** - remove directory
	**make**  - another way to compile a program. 'make FILENAME' 
	
with c you must declare what kind of variable you are creating

library: a collection of functions that know how to do specific things
	to include a library: #include <LIBRARY-NAME>
	
stdio.h: Input and Output operations can also be performed in C++ using the C Standard Input and Output Library (cstdio, known as stdio.h in the C language.
	reference: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/
	
	
floats usually use 32 bits. doubles use 64 bits

single quoates are meant for single characters
double quotes are meant for multiple characters



sometimes we might run into a case where a function needs to be called before it is declared (chronologically in the code). we can copy the first line of the function and paste it in the top of the code, rather than moving the entire function which could get messy in huge projects. This is called a prototype.

        EXAMPLE: 

        #include <cs50.h>
        #include <stdio.h>

        int square (int n) //this is the prototype.
        int main(void)
        {
            int x = get_int("x: ");
            printf("%i\n", square(x));
        }

        int square (int n) //this is where the prototype is made
        {
            return n *n;
        }

Command Line (Linux/Mac only):
	ls: list of all files in directory
	cp: copy. takes source (file) and destination (file)
		$ cp hello.txt hi.txt
		//makes copy of 'hello' and calls it 'hi'

		$cp -r folder1 folder2
		//makes copy of folder1 and calls it folder2

		$ rm <file>
		//removes file

		$rm -r folder1
		//removes folder1

		$m file1 file2
		//renames file1 to file2


WEEK 1 CONTINUED


	characters of string: string[i]
	ascii of a character: (int) string[i]
	strlen(string)
		must #include <string.h>

		
	int main(void) --- the void represents that this takes no input_iterator
	
	int main(int argc, string argv[])
		int is total number of letters the human typed upon execution
		string argv[] is an array of what the human typed execution
		argv[0] is the program name
		
	Segmentation fault means we touched memory that is not ours to use, change, or view
	
**Functions**

	type functionName(ptype1 para1, ptype 2 para2)
	ex: double mult_two_reals(double x, double y);
