/*Lecture Week 1*/

when naming files, always use lowercase - no spaces

IDE - integrated devloper environment 

compiling means converting code into machine code
source code -> compiler -> machine code

	$clang FILE-NAME
	clang <- clanguage

when we run a compiler is output in an 'a.out' file

to run code in cs50's IDE:
	./a.out

	. 		<- look in my current directory
	/ 		<- separator 
	a.out   <- compiled file name
	
to name a file in cs50's IDE:
	clang -o hello hello.c
	
	clang   <- compile (clanguage)
	-o 	  	<- stands to output
	hello	<- file name we want
	hello.c <- file we want to compile
	
	
	
command line commands:
	**ls** - list all the files in this directory. 
			/* programs are green with starts (executable)
				text files are white 
				folders are blue with a trailing slash */
				
	**mkdir** - make directory
	**rmdir** - remove directory
	**make**  - another way to compile a program. 'make FILENAME' 
	
with c you must declare what kind of variable you are creating

library: a collection of functions that know how to do specific things
	to include a library: #include <LIBRARY-NAME>
	
stdio.h: Input and Output operations can also be performed in C++ using the C Standard Input and Output Library (cstdio, known as stdio.h in the C language.
	reference: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/
	
	
floats usually use 32 bits. doubles use 64 bits

single quoates are meant for single characters
double quotes are meant for multiple characters
